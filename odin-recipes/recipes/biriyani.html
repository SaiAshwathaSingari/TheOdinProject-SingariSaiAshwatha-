     <h1>Description</h1>
     <p>Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish, known for its rich combination of spices, basmati rice, and either meat or vegetables. To make biryani, start by marinating your choice of protein—like chicken, lamb, or vegetables—with yogurt and spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, and chili powder. Separately, cook basmati rice with whole spices like cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom until it is partially done. In a large pot, layer the marinated protein at the bottom, followed by a layer of partially cooked rice. Top each layer with fried onions, fresh herbs like mint and coriander, and saffron-infused milk for extra aroma and richness. Seal the pot tightly and cook on low heat using the "dum" method, allowing the flavors to meld together as the rice finishes cooking. Biryani is traditionally served with cooling raita or yogurt to complement the spiced layers. It’s a beloved dish across South Asia, known for its balance of spices and textures</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
<li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
<li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
<li>2 medium tomatoes, chopped</li>
<li>2 small green chile peppers</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons garam masala</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>5 sprigs cilantro</li>
<li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, skin removed and cut into pieces</li>
<li>2 quarts water</li>
<li>4 cups uncooked basmati rice</li>
<li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
<li>1 bay leaf</li>
<li>4 pods green cardamom</li>
<li>1 pod black cardamom</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon powdered yellow food coloring</li>

    </ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in yogurt and vinegar. Add onion; cook and stir until golden and tender. Add tomatoes, chile peppers, garlic, and ginger paste. Cook and stir until tomatoes are tender. Season with garam masala, mint, salt, and pepper. Stir in cilantro.</li>
    <li>Place chicken into tomato-onion mixture in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Mix in cinnamon stick, bay leaf, green cardamom, and black cardamom. Season with salt. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and cardamom.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/2 of the cooked rice in the bottom of a large serving dish. Pour chicken mixture on top. Cover with remaining cooked rice. Sprinkle with food coloring; mix to serve.</li>
