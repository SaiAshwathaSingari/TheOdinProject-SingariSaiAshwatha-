     <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and cheese. To prepare, begin by making a hearty meat sauce with ground beef or sausage, simmered in a tomato-based sauce with onions, garlic, and herbs like basil and oregano. Simultaneously, prepare a smooth béchamel sauce by whisking butter, flour, and milk together until creamy. In a baking dish, layer the cooked lasagna noodles, spreading alternating layers of meat sauce, béchamel, and mozzarella or ricotta cheese. Repeat the process, finishing with a generous topping of cheese. Bake the lasagna until bubbling and golden brown on top, then let it rest before serving to allow the flavors to meld together. This savory dish is perfect for gatherings and comforting dinners</p>
