    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Paneer Tikka is a popular Indian appetizer made by marinating cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a spiced yogurt mixture and grilling them to perfection. To prepare, start by mixing plain yogurt with spices such as cumin, coriander, garam masala, turmeric, and red chili powder. Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and lemon juice to the marinade for an extra burst of flavor. Toss cubes of paneer in the marinade and let them absorb the spices for at least 30 minutes. Skewer the marinated paneer along with vegetables like onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes. Grill or bake until the paneer is golden and slightly charred on the edges. Serve with mint chutney and lemon wedges for a delicious and smoky appetizer. Paneer Tikka is a vegetarian favorite, perfect for barbecues, parties, or as a starter to an Indian meal.</p>
